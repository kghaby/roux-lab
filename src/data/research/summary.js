      An important focus of our laboratory is the understanding of the structure 
      and function of ion channels. We are particularly interested 
      in issues about ion permeation, ion selectivity, gating, and 
      channel inhibitors. We are currently working on the KcsA
      channel, the OmpF porin, and the gramicidin A
      channel. We are also spending our efforts in the development 
      of new computational approaches for studying biological macromolecular 
      systems.

      The computational approach called "molecular dynamics" (MD) is central to our 
      work. It consists of constructing detailed atomic models of 
      the macromolecular system and, having described the microscopic 
      forces with a potential function, using Newton's classical 
      equation, <i>F=MA</i>, to literally "simulate" the dynamical 
      motions of all the atoms as a function of time. The calculated 
      trajectory, though an approximation to the real world, provides 
      detailed information about the time course of the atomic motions, 
      which is impossible to access experimentally.

      In addition, other computational approaches, at different level of complexity 
      and sophistication, can be very useful. In particular, Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) 
      continuum electrostatic models, in which the influence of the solvent is incorporated implicitly, 
      plays an increasingly important role in estimating the solvation free energy 
      of macromolecular assemblies.
