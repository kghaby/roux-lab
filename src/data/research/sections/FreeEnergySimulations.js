    <p>
      By and large, microscopic processes such as ion permeation, 
      macromolecular conformational changes, ligand binding specificity, 
      and protein-protein association are driven thermodynamically 
      by the free energy (or potential of mean force) in diverse 
      and complex environments such as bulk aqueous solution, 
      the active site of an enzyme, the interior of an ion channel, 
      or a bilayer membrane. A quantitative determination of free 
      energies is thus a problem of central importance in theoretical 
      biophysics. We are currently developing and extending current methodologies 
      to allow precise and computationally inexpensive free energy calculations 
      (see <a href="http://ojps.aip.org/journals/doc/JCPSA6-ft/vol_111/iss_8/3387_1.html">Pomes et al, 1999</a>,{" "}
