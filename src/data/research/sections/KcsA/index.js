      The determination of the structure of the KcsA K+ channel 
      from <i>Streptomyces lividan</i> has made it possible 
      to investigate the function of a biological channel at the 
      atomic level (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5360/69">Doyle et al, 1998</a>). 
      Because of its structural similarity with 
      eukaryotic K-channels, investigations of KcsA are expected 
      to help understand a large class of biologically important 
      channels. We are currently working on several fundamental 
      aspects of the function of the KcsA channel such as, electrostatics, multi-ion 
      permeation, channel gating, and inhibition by various blocking agents (see{" "}
