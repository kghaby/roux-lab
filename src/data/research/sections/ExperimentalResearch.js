      Our group includes a fully-equipped experimental lab, performing expression and purification of proteins such as Hck tyrosine kinase and OmpF Porin. These proteins are characterized using X-ray diffraction and SAXS scattering (see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/36/15757.full">Yang et al, 2010</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.11.042">Dhakshnamoorthy et al, 2010</a>).
