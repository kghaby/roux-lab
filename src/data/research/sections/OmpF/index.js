    <p>
      The outer membrane of <i>Escherichia coli</i> protects the 
      cell against hostile agents and facilitates the uptake of 
      nutrients. This activity is mediated by macromolecular structures 
      called porins. Porins are not very selective and have only 
      some specificity towards cations or anions. 
      The porins represent ideal systems for addressing the fundamental 
      electrostatics principles governing ion flow in molecular 
      pores. Because high resolution well-characterized structures 
      are available for outer membrane porins of <i>E. coli</i>, 
      they provide excellent model channel systems for computations 
      based on detailed atomic models. We are currently 
      working on the cation-selective matrixporin (OmpF) which 
      is a major component of the <i>E. coli</i> outer membrane.
