    <p>
    Integral equation liquid state 
				theories have a long history in statistical mechanics, starting with John Kirwood in 1935 (see the textbook by McQuarrie for more).  In the
				case of molecular liquids, the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) developed by David Chandler in the 1970's
				with the Percus-Yevick or hypernetted chain (HNC) closure is a simple and often useful 
				approximation for calculating solvent radial distribution function, potential of mean force, 
				and excess chemical potentials.  Here you will find a fortran program (rism.f) with some examples 
				of input files to carry such calculations.
